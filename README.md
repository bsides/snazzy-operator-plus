# Snazzy Operator Plus

A VS Code theme based on [hyper-snazzy](https://github.com/sindresorhus/hyper-snazzy) and optimised for use with the [Operator Mono](https://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/overview/) font.

I did these edits for myself since [the original repo](https://github.com/aaronthomas/vscode-snazzy-operator) doesn't seem to be active anymore. Basically I added some colors to try to remove some of the "whiteness" of the text while writting JavaScript.

## Installation

```

```

Alternatively it can be found using the Extensions search feature (⇧⌘X | ⌃⇧X).
