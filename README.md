# VS Code Snazzy Operator Plus

This is some edits I did for myself since the original repo doesn't seem to be active anymore. Basically I added some colors to try to remove some of the "whiteness" of the text while writting JavaScript.

A VS Code theme based on [hyper-snazzy](https://github.com/sindresorhus/hyper-snazzy) and optimised for use with the [Operator Mono](https://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/overview/) font.

## Installation

The theme is available on the [VS Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaronthomas.vscode-snazzy-operator) and can be installed in VS Code via Quick Open (⌘P) by running:

```
ext install vscode-snazzy-operator
```

Alternatively it can be found using the Extensions search feature (⇧⌘X).
