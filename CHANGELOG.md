# Change Log
All notable changes to the "snazzy-operator" extension will be documented in this file.

## 1.2.0
- Added darker colors for signs `<>` in html and `{}()[]` in their literal uses so they fade in the background better
- Added brighter colors for some JavaScript keywords like const, let, var, extend (storage type)
- Added darker colors for function calls inside an object
- A bunch of others: function parameters, import/export keywords, keys in object literals and their symbol `:`
